# BBS System

Code a bit messy, I have improved since then.

Refer to [history.md](./history.md) for project history. Refer to [build.md](./build.md) for instructions on building and running the application. Refer to [api.md](./api.md) for API documentation.

The [report.md](./report.md) file contains the combined information of the aforementioned files. The [report.rtf] file is a `.rtf` format snapshot of [report.md](./report.md).
